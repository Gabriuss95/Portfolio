I have to be sincere, once i've finished the guide about css and html i was taken by a feeling of euphoria
starting the project without even finishing the bootstrap and sass lessons.
I've built my portfolio starting by the desktop version,without thinking about the responsiveness of the website,
huge mistake. Once finished with the project i've made the media queries for the different types of screens.
